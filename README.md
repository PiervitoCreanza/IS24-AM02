# Codex Naturalis Implementation (Java + Apple visionOS)

## Project Overview

This project is a Java-based implementation of the table game "**Codex Naturalis**", developed as the final project for the 2023/2024 Software Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano. The team comprises Mattia Colombo, Piervito Creanza, Simone Curci, and Marco Febbo.

The implementation features both a command-line interface (CLI) and a JavaFX graphical user interface. It is structured to accommodate two main development approaches for flexibility.

### Game Description

"Codex Naturalis" is a strategic table game by Cranio Creations, where players compete to create the most valuable manuscript through card placement and layering. Learn more about the game [here](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/codex-naturalis).

## Development Approaches

### Approach A: Maven and JavaFX

1. **Initial Setup**: Begin with the "maven-archetype-archetype."
2. **Integrating JavaFX**: Integrate JavaFX into the Maven project, requiring additional configuration and dependency management.

### Approach B: IntelliJ and JavaFX

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the IntelliJ JavaFX template.
2. **Modifications**: Initially, some parts of the code will be commented out. These sections are designed for future use and can be uncommented as needed.

## Future Scope

The project is poised for adaptation to Apple's visionOS, suggesting plans for expanded compatibility and potential new features for the visionOS environment.
